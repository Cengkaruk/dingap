ClearSync Plugin: File Watch
----------------------------

The file watch plugin uses the inotify API to watch set files and/or
directories for configurable events such as create, modify, delete, etc.  When
an event occurs and associated "action-group" is executed.  Actions are delayed
in a queue for a configurable amount of time (in seconds) to prevent excessive
executions from a rapid flood of events.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The file watch plugin has, at minimum, two configuration blocks.  The order is
arbitrary.  The first set is the <action-group> block.  This tag has one
required parameter, "name", which uniquely designates the action group.  The
second parameter is an optional integer value which sets the action group's
delay queue value in seconds.  If omitted, this defaults to 5 seconds.

Inside the <action-group> block are one or more <action> tags which simply
define a program/script to run.  There can be as many <action> tags as
required.  These actions are executed in the order which they are listed.

An example <action-group> may look like this:

  <action-group name="NetworkRestart" delay="5">
    <action>sudo service firewall restart</action>
    <action>sudo service ldap condrestart</action>
    <action>sudo service nmb condrestart</action>
  </action-group>

The second type of block in the file watch configuration file is event tags
which look something like <on-xxx>...</on-xxx>.  These tags define what files
or directories to watch for a given watch type and what action group to execute
when triggered.  There are two distinct watch types.  The first is the "path"
type.  The path watch type has two required parameters.  The first is the
"type", which is set to "path".  The second is the "action-group" which defines
the action group to execute.  The file or directory path is enclosed between
the opening and closing tag.  An example "path" watch type may look like:

  <on-modify type="path" action-group="NetworkRestart">/etc/clearos/multiwan.conf</on-modify>

This watch executes the "NetworkRestart" action group when the
/etc/clearos/multiwan.conf file is modified.

The second distinct type is the "pattern" watch.  This tag has three manditory
parameters.  The first is the "type" which is set to "pattern", the second is
the "action-group", which defines the action group to execute on a matching
event.  The third is the "path" parameter which must the full path to the
directory to watch.  The tag contains the extended regular expression to match
against the files/directories that occur inside the defined path.  An example
"pattern" watch may look like:

  <on-modify type="pattern" path="/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts" action-group="NetworkRestart">^ifcfg-.*</on-modify>

This watch executes the "NetworkRestart" action group when a file contained
within /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts that matches the regular expression
"^ifcfg-.*" matches a file that is modified.

There are several watch event types and they directly correspond with the
inotify(7) watch types:

Tag               Inotify                      Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<on-access>       IN_ACCESS                    File was accessed (read).
<on-attrib>       IN_ATTRIB                    Inode was changed (ie: chown).
<on-close>        IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE             File was closed (no write).
<on-close-write>  IN_CLOSE_WRITE               File was closed (written).
<on-create>       IN_CREATE                    File was created.
<on-delete>       IN_DELETE | IN_DELETE_SELF   File was deleted.
<on-modify>       IN_MODIFY                    File was modified.
<on-move>         IN_MOVE_SELF |
                  IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO  File was moved.
<on-open>         IN_OPEN                      File was opened.
<on-all>          IN_ALL_EVENTS                Any of the above.

Note, some of these events have different behaviours depending on whether the
watched inode is a file or directory.  See the man page inotify(7) for details.
