ClearSync: System Synchronization Daemon
----------------------------------------

This is a generic daemon which can be loaded with plugins to perform various
system syncronization tasks.  For example, watch a file or directory for
changes and then run an external program/script.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The main configuration file, by default, resides in /etc/clearsync.conf.  The
default directory containing plugin configuration files is /etc/clearsync.d.

Configuration files are formatted as XML documents.  The main configuration
file currently has only one configuration tag, <plugin-dir>, used to set or
override the default plugin configuration directory.  An example ClearSync
configuration file looks like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!-- ClearSync Example Configuration -->
<csconf version="1">
  <plugin-dir>/etc/clearsync.d</plugin-dir>
</csconf>

Plugin configuration files have no specific format other than the required
opening tag, <plugin>.  This directive has 2 mandatory parameters, "name" and
"library".  The "name" parameter is a unique friendly name for the plugin.  It
must be unique across all loaded plugins.  The "library" parameter is either a
relative or absolute path to a shared library (including the extension, .so).
The third parameter, "stack-size" is optional and sets the plugins thread stack
size.  If not set, this defaults to the lowest possible value of 16384 bytes.
Note, the stack-size should be a multiple of the system's page size (in Linux
this is 4096 bytes).  If a plugin appears to crash randomly, for no apparent
reason, most likely the stack size is too small, try doubling it.

An example plugin configuration file may look like this (trimmed down from the
"filewatch" plugin):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!-- ClearSync File Watch Plugin Configuration -->
<plugin name="FileWatch" library="libcsplugin-filewatch.so" stack-size="65536">
  <action-group name="NetworkRestart" delay="5">
    <action>sudo service firewall restart</action>
  </action-group>

  <on-modify type="path" action-group="NetworkRestart">/etc/clearos/network.conf</on-modify>

</plugin>

STARTING AND STOPPING THE DAEMON
--------------------------------

The daemon can be started and stopped the usual way using
/etc/init.d/clearsyncd.  The daemon saves it's PID in the /var/run/clearsync
directory as clearsyncd.pid.  As of version 1.0, there is no graceful reload
support (SIGHUP), so configuration changes must be reloaded by restarting the
service.

LOGGING
-------

When running as a daemon (not in debug mode), normal, warning, and error
messages are logged using the system logger.  Usually these messages are sent
to /var/log/messages using the LOG_DAEMON facility.

PLUGIN STATE
------------

Some plugins may save and load state data.  State data is automatically loaded
on plugin initialization and saved on plugin termination.  To enable plugin
state support you must add a <state-file>...</state-file> directive to the
plugins configuration file (inside the <plugin>...</plugin> block).  For
example:

<plugin ...>
  <state-file>/var/lib/state/clearsync/state.dat</state-file>
</plugin>

PLUGIN EVENT FILTER
-------------------

Some plugins may dispatch events during operation and some other plugins may be
interested in reading them.  In order for a plugin to receive events from other
plugins, a <event-filter> directive must be specified.  The event filter
directive will contain the friendly name (or names) of other plugins (such as
FileWatch) as a pipe "|" delimited list.  If for example, the plugin your are
configuring should receive events from FileWatch and RouteWatch, the
<event-filter> may look like this (again, must be within the <plugin> block):

<plugin ...>
  <event-filter>FileWatch | RouteWatch</event-filter>
</plugin>

DEBUGGING
---------

To help troubleshoot problems, the daemon can be run in debug mode by passing
the -d, (--debug) command-line switch.  In this mode the program continue to
run in the foreground and also emits additional debug-level messages.  The PID
will not be saved when running in this mode.
