ClearSync: System Synchronization Daemon
----------------------------------------

This is a generic daemon which can be loaded with plugins to perform various
system syncronization tasks.  For example, watch a file or directory for
changes and then run an external program/script.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The main configuration file, by default, resides in /etc/clearsync.conf.  The
default directory containing plugin configurations files is /etc/clearsync.d.

Configuration files are formatted as XML documents.  The main configuration
file currently has only one configuration tag, <plugin-dir>, used to set or
override the default plugin configuration directory.  An example ClearSync
configuration file looks like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!-- ClearSync Example Configuration -->
<csconf version="1">
  <plugin-dir>/etc/clearsync.d</plugin-dir>
</csconf>

Plugin configuration files have no specific format other than the required
opening tag, <plugin>.  This directive has 2 mandatory parameters, "name" and
"library".  The "name" parameter is a unique friendly name for the plugin.  It
must be unique across all loaded plugins.  The "library" parameter is either a
relative or absolute shared library path/filename (including the extension,
.so).  The third parameter, "stack-size" is optional and sets the plugins
thread stack size.  If not set, this defaults to the lowest possible value of
16384 bytes.  Note, the stack-size should be a multiple of the system's page
size (in Linux this is 4096 bytes).  If a plugin appears to crash randomly, for
no apparent reason, most likely the stack size is too small, try doubling it.

An example plugin configuration file may look like this (trimmed down from the
"filewatch" plugin):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!-- ClearSync File Watch Plugin Configuration -->
<plugin name="FileWatch" library="libcsplugin-filewatch.so" stack-size="65536">
  <action-group name="NetworkRestart" delay="5">
    <action>sudo service firewall restart</action>
  </action-group>

  <on-modify type="path" action-group="NetworkRestart">/etc/clearos/network.conf</on-modify>

</plugin>

STARTING AND STOPPING THE DAEMON
--------------------------------

The daemon can be started and stopped the usual way using
/etc/init.d/clearsyncd.  The daemon saves it's PID in the /var/run/clearsync
directory as clearsyncd.pid.  As of version 1.0, there is currently no SIGHUP
support so configuration changes must be reloaded by restarting the service.

LOGGING
-------

When running as a daemon (not in debug mode), normal, warning, and error
messages are logged using the system syslog service.  Usually these messages
are sent to /var/log/messages using the LOG_DAEMON facility.

PLUGIN STATE
------------

Some plugins may save and load state data.  By default, plugin state is saved
in a file of the same name in /var/state/clearsync.

DEBUGGING
---------

To help troubleshoot problems, the daemon can be run in debug mode by passing
the -d (or --debug) command-line switch.  In the mode, the program continue to
run in the foreground and will also emit additional debug-level messages.  The
program's PID will not be saved when running in this mode.
