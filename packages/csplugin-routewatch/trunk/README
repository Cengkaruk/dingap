ClearSync Plugin: Route Watch
-----------------------------

The route watch plugin monitors a configurable routing table for changes and on
an event, executes the supplied external program/script.  Events are delayed by
a configurable amount of time (in seconds) to prevent a build-up of events
which result in excessive executions.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The route watch configuration file currently has only one tag,
<on-route-change>.  This directive has one mandatory parameter, "table".  The
argument for this parameter is an integer value representing the routing table
ID to watch.  For example, the default table has ID 254.  There is a second
parameter, "delay", which also expects an integer value representing the amount
of time (in seconds) to queue execution of the set program/script.  By default,
if omitted, this is set to 5 seconds.

An example route watch configuration may look like this:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!-- ClearSync Route Watch Plugin Configuration -->
<plugin name="RouteWatch" library="libcsplugin-routewatch.so" stack-size="65536">
  <on-route-change table="254" delay="5">sudo service firewall restart</on-route-change>
</plugin>

This example monitors routing table 254 (main) for changes and executes a
firewall restart after the last event is queued for 5 seconds.
