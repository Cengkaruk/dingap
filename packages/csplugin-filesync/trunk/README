ClearSync Plugin: File Sync
---------------------------

The file sync plugin is a simple master/slave file synchronization tool.
Slaves connect to a master over a common TCP port at repeating intervals.
Every packet is signed using SHA1 and then encrypted using a 256-bit AES shared
key.  For each configured file, the slave sends it's local SHA1 signature to
the master.  The master compares this with it's own and if they differ, informs
the slave a sync is required.  The master also sends the file's ownership and
access rights to the slave which are used to ensure the slave's version is in
sync.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The file sync plugin has one global configuration tag, <authkey>, which is a
256-bit AES key specified as a 64-byte hexadecimal string.  This is a mandatory
tag for both master and slave configurations.  There are two configuration
block types, <master ...> and <slave ...>.  These blocks contain the list of
files.  For the master, these are the files to export for synchronization, and
inversely for the slave, these are the files requested from the master to sync.
The <master ...> and <slave ...> blocks have required parameters that specify
the TCP address and port to either bind on or connect to respectively.

The global authentication key, common between master and slave configurations,
is formatted similar to (64 characters long):

<authkey>0123456789abcdef ... 0123456789abcdef</authkey>

An example <master ...> block may look like this:

  <master bind="all" port="8154">
    <file name="Hosts File">/etc/hosts</file>
    <file name="SSL Certificate">/etc/ssl/somecert.pem</file>
  </master>

An example <slave ...> block may look like this:

  <slave host="192.168.10.1" port="8154" interval="600">
    <file name="Hosts File">/etc/hosts</file>
    <file name="SSL Certificate">/etc/ssl/somecert.pem</file>
  </slave>

The <file ...> tag for slaves have two optional parameters.  They are
presync="" and postsync="" which specify external commands to run just before
and just after a sync operation.  If the presync command exits with a non-zero value the sync operation is aborted.
